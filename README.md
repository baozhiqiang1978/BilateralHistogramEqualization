## Bilateral Histogram Equalization :

This Matlab source code introduces Bilateral Histogram Equalization, a fusion-based strategy to implement a locally adaptive tone mapping that approximates histogram equalization on a support that is implicitly defined by the diffusion capabilities of a joint-bilateral filter.


We highly recommend reading the related paper 'BILATERAL HISTOGRAM EQUALIZATION FOR X-RAY IMAGE TONE MAPPING' <Tahani Madmad &  Devleeschauwer Christophe - IEEE ICIP 2019>, for a formal presentation of BHE tone-mapping algorithm.
